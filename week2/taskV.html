//good	will	be	offered	each	day	but	that	there	is	only	a	limited	stock	(7	items)	of	each	item	available.	Once	one
//good	runs	out,	all	supply	for	the	rest	of	the	month	is	cut.	Create	a	page	that	will	print	out	something	similar	to
//the	following:
//On the 1st of the month specs are available
//On the 2nd of the month mugs are available
//â€¦
//On the 17th of the month sausage rolls are available
//No more goods are available this month
//On	the	4th of	the	month	specs	and	sausage	rolls	are	available
